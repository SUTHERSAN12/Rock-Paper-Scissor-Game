# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
Rock-Paper-scissor game created using DOM manipulation.
DOM manipulation allows developers to interact with and modify the structure, style, and content of web pages.

Here we play the game against a computer and the computer makes a random move and the scores are updated after each round.
We can also reset the scores if we want, and then the scores start counting from zero.
